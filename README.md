# 📖 Overview

Climate change has significantly increased flooding, irregular rainfall, and extreme weather events across many regions, especially in developing countries.

These events affect:

- Agriculture
- Aquaculture
- Transportation
- Urban Planning
- Disaster Management
- Public Health

This project builds a production-inspired Data Engineering platform that automatically collects weather data, validates it, transforms it into analytics-ready datasets, calculates environmental risk indicators, and publishes business-ready datasets to BigQuery for interactive dashboards in Looker Studio.

Instead of only reporting weather conditions, this platform provides actionable recommendations that support informed decision-making.

---

# 🎯 Objectives

The project aims to:

- Build a complete end-to-end ETL pipeline
- Demonstrate production-ready Data Engineering practices
- Implement a Medallion Architecture
- Automate weather data ingestion
- Calculate climate risk indicators
- Generate agricultural and aquaculture advisories
- Publish analytics datasets to BigQuery
- Build executive dashboards using Looker Studio

---

# 🌍 Business Problem

Heavy rainfall and flooding continue to cause:

- Crop destruction
- Fish pond overflow
- Soil erosion
- Infrastructure damage
- Disease outbreaks
- Economic losses

Although weather data is publicly available, most organizations lack automated systems that transform raw weather data into actionable intelligence.

This platform bridges that gap.

---

# 💡 Solution

The platform transforms raw weather observations into meaningful insights by calculating:

- Flood Risk Score
- Crop Stress Index
- Soil Waterlogging Index
- Pond Overflow Risk
- Heat Stress Index
- Rainfall Anomaly
- Weather Severity Score

The processed datasets are loaded into BigQuery where they can be analyzed using SQL and visualized in Looker Studio.
